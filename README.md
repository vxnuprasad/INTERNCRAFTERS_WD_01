# Interactive Navigation Menu (Scroll and Hover Effects)

This project features an interactive, responsive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or hovered over. The navigation menu is fixed in position, ensuring it is always visible on all pages, and provides a seamless, user-friendly interface.

## Features

1. **Fixed Position:** The menu stays at the top of the page, even as the user scrolls through the content.
2. **Hover Effects:** Menu items change style, such as font color or background, when hovered over.
3. **Scroll-Based Changes:** The background color or style of the menu dynamically changes as the user scrolls.
4. **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly on various screen sizes, including mobile and desktop.
5. **Lightweight:** Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for optimal performance.
